# Basic Widgets Examples

Here you will find a quick way to customise the basic flutter widgets to your taste. 

## Run this project

**EDIT** : No need of running the project, simply run the code in the new official Flutter online compiler [DartPad](https://dartpad.dartlang.org/flutter).

### Still want to run the project?
- Fork this project.
- Rename the directory to "my_basic_widgets" or something with all_lowercase_and_underscore. (Unfortunately, Flutter does not like capital letters.)
- In your terminal, run flutter create . This will create the android and iOS projects for you.
- Run in your emulator or device.
